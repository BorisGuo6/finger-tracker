## Description

The glove uses rotating neodymium magnets and hall effect sensors at each joint to measure rotation. The thumb has 4 sensors and the fingers have 3 each. Each sensor is wired up to a multiplexer and powered with a common GND/VCC strip. I used a XIAO ESP32C3 as the microcontroller for its small form factor. This project builds upon Nepyope's glove shown here: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPtgvh6fNdQ).

## Getting Started

### 3D Printing

All the files are in the CAD folder. For Nepyope's parts I have just the STL with all of the pieces (and I dont use all of them). For my parts I have all of them as STLs and most of them have SLDPT and STEP versions.

Nepyope's Parts:
* 16x sensor boxes and lids
* Connecting rods (12 total, I used 11 of them as I changed one)
* 4x Finger second piece
* Thumb second piece

You can print the STL with all the parts and just use the ones listed above


My Parts:
* Enclosure
* Enclosure top
* Thumb bracket
* 4x finger endpiece
* Thumb endpiece
* Thumb middle piece
* Thumb first piece
* Thumb short rod (flipped from nepyopeâ€™s design)
* 4x Finger first joint

### Tools

* Soldering tools (iron, solder, flux, etc)
* Cutters, wire stripers, etc
* Superglue
* 1.5mm and 2.5mm allen keys

### Firmware

The firmware was made using PlatformIO in the Arduino framework. You can comment and uncomment the print functions to print raw values, adjusted angle values, or all the values in a single string. The raw value and adjusted angle values print in a way where Teleplot (serial plotter VSCode extension) can read and plot them. A teleplot layout is in the teleplot folder.
